      This is my reading list from the past few days. I decided to put them here as it might be helpful to someone else. It was deeply inspired by HighScalability blog, a source I’ve been consuming for years. Microsoft all over the places Microsoft keeps its push to become a major player in the Open Source community. Let's take a look at the majestic presence they have at the media recently. At Microsoft, 47,000 developers...

      In the 2000s we went from documenting every single class of our software to not at all. It was an attempt to increase the delivery pace, keeping the team away from tasks that, eventually, have to be remade once the software changes. As a side effect, scaling the team became a problem. The most notable one is the lack of autonomy from its members. Not only newcomers need special attention to get familiarized with the...

      A few days ago, I spotted a blog post from StackOverflow that drew my attention: Ensuring backwards compatibility in distributed systems. That is the sort of topic I love to consume as it gives me new insights and let me know how people are solving similar problems. The article was engagingly good and kept me focused on reading it until the end. I would like, though, to write a few remarks about a few definitions...

      This an opinionated transcription of a talk that Sam Newman has presented in the 2019 GOTO Conference, Berlin edition. There were several points on his presentation that, I think, were spot on and deserves to be transcribed and better explained. There is a bit of a debate about whether or not to start from a Monolith and then move to a Microservice Architecture. Understanding how decomposing monolith might not only shed a light on this...

      When someone is described as a professional one might see that person as someone who does something for a living. Others might agree with the Cambridge dictionary, seeing professionals as those who have “[…] the type of job that needs a high level of education and training” 1. Perhaps we can all agree that the meaning of words evolves as time passes by - having its meaning adapted to suit a more recent context. Maybe...
