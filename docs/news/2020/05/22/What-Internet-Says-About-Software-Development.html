        <h2>Rust on the Radar</h2>
        <h3>As we're talking about Rust, it seems that is not only Microsoft who's investing time and effort on it.</h3>
        <blockquote class="quote">
            <p>There are many benefits a standardized ABI would bring to Rust. A stable ABI enables dynamic linking between Rust crates, which would allow for Rust programs to support dynamically loaded plugins (a feature common in C/C++). Dynamic linking would result in shorter compile-times and lower disk-space use for projects, as multiple projects could link to the same dylib. For example, imagine having multiple CLIs all link to the same core library crate.</p>

            <p>Coming to understand the threat model for your system is not simple. There are an unlimited number of threats you can imagine to any system, and many of them could be likely. [...] Cyber threats chain in unexpected, unpredictable and even chaotic ways. Factors to do with culture, process and technology all contribute. This complexity and uncertainty is at the root of the cyber security problem. This is why security requirements are so hard for software development teams to agree upon.</p>

            <p>We recently migrated a few small systems to CockroachDB (as a stepping stone). Overall, the experience was positive. The hassle free HA is a huge peace of mind. I know people say this is easy to do in PG. I have recently setup 2ndQuadrant's pglogical for another system. That was also easy (though the documentation was pretty bad). The end result is quite different though and CockroachDB is just simpler to reason about and manage and, I think, more generally applicable.</p>

            <p>Although event-driven architecture has existed for more than 15 years, only recently has it gained massive popularity, and there is a reason for that. Most companies are going through a “digital transformation” phase, and with that, crazy requirements occur. The complexity of these requirements force engineers to adopt new ways of designing software, ones that incur less coupling between services and lower maintenance overhead. EDA is one solution to these problems but it is not the only one.</p>
