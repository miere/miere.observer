## About This Blog
I'm a Lead Software Engineer who has been working in the industry since 2000. I worked as CTO for a small startup a few years ago and helped them to go overseas by providing them an affordable and stable cloud platform capable of handling hundreds of millions of users per day. Since then I've been putting myself as the bridge between C-Level stakeholders and technical teams in the companies I've been working for, helping them to achieve their KPIs. While my _heart_ is passionate for well crafted and easily maintainable software, which is the reason Iâ€™ve been actively coding since then, my _brain_ is motivated on making software development that delivers actual value to my customers.

I created this blog to express my ideas, observations and thoughts. This is a blog composed of my personal observations and thoughts. I write about mostly about technology, science and software engineering, but I might write occasionally about history and politics as well. I shall try my best to keep it as scientific as possible, using facts to support my point of view. Hopefully, you will give me a hand whenever I did a mistake.

You can find me in a few places over the internet. Feel free to contact me, I'll try my best to answer you as soon as possible.
