<p>This is a video analysis post in which I'll elaborate on a few points exposed by <a href="https://empear.com/blog/">Adam Tornhill</a> on a talk presented in the 2019 GOTO Conference that happened in Copenhagen. There are several points on his presentation that, I think, are spot on and deserves to be transcribed and better explained. _Technical Debts_ as a concept is something usually underrated by several (if not most of) big companies. The amount of money and man-hour effort spent fixing problems <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/133824/is-it-significantly-costlier-to-fix-a-bug-at-the-end-of-the-project">is often pointed</a> as an order of magnitude higher than avoiding it before being released into production.</p>
