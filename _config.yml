description: Miere's Personal Observations
about: This is a blog composed of my personal observations and thoughts. I write about mostly about technology, science and software engineering, but I might write occasionally about history and politics as well. I shall try my best to keep it as scientific as possible, using facts to support my point of view. Hopefully, you will give me a hand whenever I did a mistake.
